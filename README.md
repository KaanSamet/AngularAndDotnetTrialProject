# AngularAndDotnetTrialProject
This is an angular app with .Net API and I basically tried to learn basic concepts.


Angular CLI: 16.2.0
Node: 20.5.1 (Unsupported)
Package Manager: npm 6.14.18
OS: win32 x64

- I also downloaded Angular Language Service in VSCode.

- In my project folder, I run the command ng new CRUD.UI to set up my project, I used Angular routing and CSS.
- I then right clicked my project name and opened with integrated terminal.
- I created components, models and services folders inside the CRUD_Project\CRUD.UI\src\app folder.

-----

There are two main folders. 

- CRUD.UI consists of the angular application that is able to connect an SQL server and perform all CRUD operations via the .NET API. There are buttons on the .html folders that are able to connect and perform the CRUD operations and app can take inputs from the user such that desired values can be changed on the SQL database.
- CRUD_API consits of the .NET API that is able to perform Create, Read, Update and Delete operations.
- I used Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for my SQL server and I migrated the project.
